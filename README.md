# Belief-Propagation-decoder-of-Polar-Codes
The GitHub repository includes a Belief Propagation (BP) decoder for Dr. Erdal Arikan's classical Polar Codes, which implements sequential and parallel layer schedulers. With this decoder, you can efficiently decode Polar Codes using the BP algorithm with either sequential or parallel scheduling.

The Polar Code decoder is included in the repository and can be easily implemented in MATLAB. The decoder uses Dr. Arikan's algorithms to schedule the decoding of the Polar Code layers, allowing for efficient decoding performance.
